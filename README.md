# Docker Kits

## Summary

The repository is the collection of kits built on the top of docker image. At the very begiinning, the repository was built for kits used for infrastructure. It is about to expand the scope from infrastructure to simplify the integration test, even build for speical development.

Repository name in Docker Hub: [harryh00/docker-kits](https://hub.docker.com/r/harryh00/docker-kits)


## Why chooses docker

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package. 

## Benefits

Containers work a little like VMs, but in a far more specific and granular way. The benefits of Docker containers show up in many places. Here are some of the advantages of Docker used as tool kits:

* Docker enables more efficient use of system resources
* Docker enables faster software delivery cycles
* Docker enables application portability

docker run --rm -it -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws  harryh00/docker-kits:alpine-aws2
```

* Sample 3: use k8s cli kit 

```
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube:/root/.kube -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws  harryh00/docker-kits:alpine-k8s
```

### How to build & push 

By default the script will build and push image to [harryh00/docker-kits](https://hub.docker.com/r/harryh00/docker-kits), but you can simply provide your docker repository to build these images to your repo.

```
./build.sh <your_docker_repo>

```
